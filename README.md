# React Dashboard on Kubernetes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This project is designed to further my understanding (and maybe yours!) in the following concepts
- React
- CSS
- Kubernetes

## About the project

The idea of this project is to provide a simple, easy to understand example of hosting a React 
web application on containers using Kubernetes. The app itself will be a simple example of a 
web dashboard, including some example content, CSS etc, while also including the files required
to create a Kubernetes deployment of the front end along with supporting services.
